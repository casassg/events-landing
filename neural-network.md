title: The Neural Network
---

In the 2017-2018 academic year, former student [Izzy Aguiar](www.izabelpaguiar.com) started the Neural Network, which is an interview series featuring some of the cool humans in our department.  We are currently rebooting the neural network (I don't apologize for the plethora of CS puns here) with some new features that will be hosted here.

If you have a recommendation on someone you want to see featured, please email [Jessie Finocchiaro](mailto:jefi8453@colorado.edu).

The interviews from the first year can be found on Izzy's website [here](https://izabelpaguiar.com/nn/).

Newer interviews include:
 * [Sagi Shaier](neural-network/sagi_shaier_nn.pdf)
 * [Nasim Sonboli](neural-network/nasim_sonboli_nn.pdf)
 * [Vinitha Gadiraju](neural-network/vinitha_gadiraju_nn.pdf)
 * [Rebecca Morrison](neural-network/rebecca_morrison_nn.pdf)
 * [Alici Edwards](neural-network/alici_edwards_nn.pdf)
 * [Evariste Somé](neural-network/evariste_some_nn.pdf)
 * [Kaleb Bishop](neural-network/kaleb_bishop_nn.pdf)
 * [Jay Luther](neural-network/jay_luther_nn.pdf)
